  <h2 class="featurette-heading">About Me</h2>
  <p class="lead">
  
<p>Life is a function that depends on many variables.<p>

<p>I graduated from an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in 
  <a href = "https://wacoma.unibo.it/promotion_dissemination.php"> Water and Coastal Management</a>, fully funded by the European Union, and hosted by the University of Bologna (Italy), the University of Cadiz (Spain), and the University of Algarve (Portugal). In Italy, the programme is recognised as the international curriculum of the second cycle degree in Environmental Assessment and Management.</p>

<p>Additionally, I hold a bachelor's degree in Water Resources Management with a major in Hydrology from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria</a>.</p>

<p>My background, interest, and focus have always been about earth sciences subjects such as geography, water resources management, river science, and hydrology. The need to understand how coastal water resources and other related impacts are managed and tackled in developed countries prompted me to seek a new challenge abroad (MSc Sojourn). In the quest of learning, I have acquired skill sets in statistical methods and models, R and Python programming, analytical techniques, remote sensing systems, and more. These techniques have become excellent tools for me to explore solutions to different water problems.</p>
