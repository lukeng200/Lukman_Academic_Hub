  <h2 class="featurette-heading">About Me</h2>
  <p class="lead">
  
Life is a function that depends on many variables.

In 2020, I completed an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in <a href = "https://wacoma.unibo.it/promotion_dissemination.php"> Water and Coastal Management</a>, fully funded by the European Union, and hosted by the University of Bologna (Italy), the University of Cadiz (Spain), and the University of Algarve (Portugal). In Italy, the programme is recognised as the international curriculum of the second cycle degree in Environmental Assessment and Management</a>. 

In 2015, I completed my bachelor's degree in Water Resources Management with a major in Hydrology from the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria. </a>

Overall, my background interest and focus have always been about water and earth sciences. The need to gain more insight about water and coastal hydro-complexities made me seek several challenges abroad (MSc and PhD sojourn).</a> 

In the quest of learning, I have acquired numerous skill sets such as data analysis and visualisation (using R and a fair bit of Python) and models, GIS, GPR, remote sensing, and more.</a>
